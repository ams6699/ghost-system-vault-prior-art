# ‚úÖ Verification Instructions
To independently verify authorship and timestamp:

# Compute the SHA-256 hash of your local declaration PDF:

# sha256sum 
# Ghost_System_Vault_Declaration_With_Annex_Updated.pdf
# Ghost System Vault ‚Äì Growth Locking System.pdf
# Ghost System Vault - Growth Locking Logic (1).pdf
# Updated_Profit_Locking_IP_Declaration.pdf
# Vault_Based_Profit_Locking_BTC_ETH_XRP.pdf
Confirm that the output matches the hash above.

You may optionally verify the timestamp using OpenTimestamps (if you hold the corresponding .ots file privately).
